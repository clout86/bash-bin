# bash-bin
   some use(full/less) Bash utilities, I place them in ${HOME}/bin.


### mostly practice code, and test scripts. Maybe something is useful for you.
* toolings for AwesomeWM, gentoo and perhaps others. 
* If you want to deploy any of this code, good luck. 

### simple_genkern_update.sh
* trying to be posix compliant, please complain if it isn't. 

### prekernel_chroot.sh
* run after disk_mount.sh && env_mount.sh
** both disk_mount.sh and env_mount.sh are pretty basic, but are hard coded

### disk_mount.sh
* needs some level of dynamic assessment of the disk space
** also need to write/find useful snippets for partion schemes.
