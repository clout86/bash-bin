# bash-bin
	some use(full/less) Bash utilities, I place them in ${HOME}/bin.
	Will try and sort and purge
# gentoo-installer
	two scipts, one that sets up the drive, the other that builds in a chroot.
	the build script probablys needs a lot of ram or MAKEOPTS=-j1 might work
	but will take time to build in a chroot either way as it pulls in some large 
	packages.
# there is another script in here
	It's a pretty basic command wrapper to help me remember qemu flags and
	write short QEMU "starter" scripts based off those flags.
